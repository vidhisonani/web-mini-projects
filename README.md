# 🌐 Web Mini Projects

A collection of small **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** projects for practice and learning purposes.

Each project is organized in its own folder with:

- `index.html`

The goal of this repository is to provide **hands-on practice for frontend development**, improve **JavaScript skills**, and create a reference collection of small projects that can be expanded over time.
